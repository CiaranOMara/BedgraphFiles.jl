## Overview

This package provides load and save support for [Bedgraph](https://github.com/CiaranOMara/Bedgraph.jl)
under the [FileIO](https://github.com/JuliaIO/FileIO.jl) package, and also implements the [IterableTables](https://github.com/davidanthoff/IterableTables.jl) interface for easy conversion between tabular data structures.

## Installation
You can install BedgraphFiles from the [Julia REPL](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/getting-started/).
Press `]` to enter [pkg mode](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Pkg/), then enter the following:

```julia
add BedgraphFiles
```

If you are interested in the cutting edge of the development, please check out the [develop branch](https://github.com/CiaranOMara/BedgraphFiles.jl/tree/develop) to try new features before release.

## Usage

### Loading bedGraph files

To load a bedGraph file into a ``Vector{Bedgraph.Record}``, use the following Julia code:
````julia
using FileIO, BedgraphFiles, Bedgraph

records = Vector{Bedgraph.Record}(load("data.bedgraph"))
````

### Saving bedGraph files

> **Note:** saving on top of an existing file will overwrite metadata/header information with a minimal working header.

The following example saves a ``Vector{Bedgraph.Record}`` to a bedGraph file:
````julia
using FileIO, BedgraphFiles, Bedgraph

records = [Bedgraph.Record("chr", i, i + 99, rand()) for i in 1:100:1000]

save("output.bedgraph", records)
````

### IterableTables
The execution of ``load`` returns a ``struct`` that adheres to the [IterableTables](https://github.com/davidanthoff/IterableTables.jl) interface, and can be passed to any function that also implements the interface, i.e. all the sinks in [IterableTable.jl](https://github.com/davidanthoff/IterableTables.jl).

The following code shows an example of loading a bedGraph file into a [DataFrame](https://github.com/JuliaData/DataFrames.jl):
```julia
using FileIO, BedgraphFiles, DataFrames

df = DataFrame(load("data.bedgraph"))
```

Here are some more examples of materialising a bedGraph file into other data structures:
```julia
using FileIO, BedgraphFiles, DataTables, IndexedTables, Gadfly

# Load into a DataTable
dt = DataTable(load("data.bedgraph"))

# Load into an IndexedTable
it = IndexedTable(load("data.bedgraph"))

# Plot directly with Gadfly
plot(load("data.bedgraph"), xmin=:leftposition, xmax=:rightposition, y=:value, Geom.bar)
```

The following code saves any compatible source to a bedGraph file:
```julia
using FileIO, BedgraphFiles

it = getiterator(data)

save("output.bedgraph", it)
```

### Using the pipe syntax

Both `load` and `save` also support the pipe syntax. For example, to load a bedGraph file into a `DataFrame`, one can use the following code:
```julia
using FileIO, BedgraphFiles, DataFrame

df = load("data.bedgraph") |> DataFrame
```

To save an iterable table, one can use the following form:
```julia
using FileIO, BedgraphFiles, DataFrame

df = # Aquire a DataFrame somehow.

df |> save("output.bedgraph")
```

The `save` method returns the data provided or `Vector{Bedgraph.Record}`. This is useful when periodically saving your work during a sequence of operations.
```julia
records = some sequence of operations |> save("output.bedgraph")
```

The pipe syntax is especially useful when combining it with [Query.jl](https://github.com/davidanthoff/Query.jl) queries. For example, one can easily load a bedGraph file, pipe its data into a query, and then store the query result by piping it to the `save` function.
```julia
using FileIO, BedgraphFiles, Query
load("data.bedgraph") |> @filter(_.chrom == "chr19") |> save("data-chr19.bedgraph")
```
